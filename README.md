# Datathon-SDG-3
My Datathon Group Project

Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) sometimes referred to as the Global Goals were enacted 
by the United Nations in 2015 as a global call to action to eradicate poverty, safeguard the 
environment and guarantee that by the year 2030, peace and prosperity will be experienced by 
everyone. There are 17 SDGs that are integrated which are no poverty, zero hunger, good health 
and well-being, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean 
energy, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation and infrastructure. Reduced 
inequalities, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, climate 
action, life below water, life on land, peace, justice and strong institutions, and partnerships for the 
goals. In our analysis, we will focus on the third goal which is good health and well-being. Under 
the third goal, the targets were to reduce maternal mortality, end all preventable deaths under 5, 
fight communicable diseases, reduce mortality from non-communicable diseases and promote 
mental health, prevent and treat substance abuse, reduce road injuries and deaths, universal access 
to sexual and reproductive care, family planning and education, achieve universal health coverage, 
reduce illnesses and death from hazardous chemicals and pollution, implement the who framework 
convention on tobacco control, support research, development and universal access to affordable 
vaccines and medicines, increase health financing and support health workforce in developing 
countries and improve early warning systems for global health risk.
